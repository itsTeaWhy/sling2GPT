Technical Challenges:

- wanted to use proxty server to hold GH user info to avoid holding sensitive data on client server
  - Ended up not using proxy server and saving GH data to client's local storage :/
- Webpack.config and dev server continue to give headaches with github OAuth (hard to know where to send GH callback URL)
  - just used build and start whenever I wanted to test functionality
